Damon Oehlman is an experienced application developer who is passionate about both web technologies and developer productivity (and is quite likely to rant on either topic given the chance).  He currently works with [Kondoot](http://kondoot.com/) as a JS specialist, and works on a number of [OpenSource projects](https://github.com/DamonOehlman) as part of his role there and also in his free time.
