# The Quest for Reusable JS

JS is everywhere.  We can use it in the browser, on a webserver and that's just the start.  Much of the code that people are writing, however, is generally implemented with only one of those platforms in mind.  We can do better though, target multiple platforms, and we don't have to wait for future versions of JS make it work!

This talk will cover writing code for the browser, NodeJS and other platforms with a strong focus on writing code once and once only.  It's the result of two years worth of skinned knees and lessons learnt due to the stubborness of one certain individual.

Topics Covered:

- JS Module approaches: CommonJS, AMD, etc
- The pros and cons of having a build process for your JS libary / app
- Testing approaches that work in multiple environments
- JS Frameworks: Do they help or hinder reusability?

This will be a thought provoking session, with plenty of time for both questions and heckling.
